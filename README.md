# BasisVoxels

A simple Voxel demo for [Basis](https://github.com/dooly123/Basis)

- Textures are from [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/)

If you want to edit the voxel data outside Unity/Basis, use [Goxel](https://github.com/guillaumechereau/goxel) and import/export as text.

# Usage

If you want to just use the library, you can either download a zip or just use Unity's package manager and the Git URL.

If you wish to develop the package, `git clone` in the `Packages` folder of Basis, and you should be good to modify the project.
